### function eqArrays(): Used to compare two arrays and return true if the given arrays are equal.
### function eqObjects(): Used to compare two objects and return true if the given arrays are equal.
### function findKey(): Takes an object and a function describes the find condition, returns the key of when condition is truthy.
### function findKeyByValue(): Takes an object and a string, returns key of value matching the string.
### function head() : Take an array and return the first element of array.
### function letterPositions(): Returns indices of all elements of a string.
### function map(): Imitates map() method of Array.
### function middle(): Returns the mid elements of an array.
